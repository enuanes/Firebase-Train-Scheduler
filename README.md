Train Schedule App

Week 7 Assignment: Train Scheduler

Created during week 7 of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to link up to firebase and moment so that information entered by a user in the app would be stored on the firebase database and updated in real time through moment.

I chose this assignment over the rock, paper, scissors game because it was hard enough even though it was easier assignment.
